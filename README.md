# VSDSquadron FM Kit

Test and demo codes for the VSDSquadron FM Kit board, built around the Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA (SG48 package). Each folder contains a standalone test for one peripheral, written in minimal, well-commented Verilog targeted at learners.

## Toolchain Installation

Install the open-source iCE40 FPGA toolchain:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y fpga-icestorm yosys nextpnr-ice40
```

This provides:
- **Yosys** — Verilog synthesis
- **nextpnr-ice40** — Place and route
- **IceStorm** — Bitstream packing (`icepack`) and flashing (`iceprog`)

## Board Peripherals

| Peripheral | Pins | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 4 LEDs | 13, 18, 19, 21 | Active-low (0 = ON) |
| Buzzer | 2 | |
| 4 Push Switches | 9, 10, 11, 12 | Active-high (1 = pressed) |
| 2 Toggle Switches | 4, 6 | Active-high, default OFF |
| RGB LED | 39, 40, 41 | Directly connected to `SB_RGBA_DRV` hard IP |
| SG90 Servo (360°) | 3 | Continuous rotation, 50 Hz PWM |
| 0.91" OLED (SSD1306) | SDA=37, SCL=36 | 128x32, I2C, address 0x3C |
| 7-Segment (2-digit) | A=32 B=31 C=28 D=27 E=26 F=25 G=23, dig1=34 dig2=35 | Active-low segments and digits, DP not connected |
| PMOD Header (8-pin) | 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 | General-purpose, active ADC connected on pmod2/4/6 |

**Common notes:**
- All designs use the internal 48 MHz oscillator (`SB_HFOSC`), divided down as needed — no external crystal required.
- The RGB LED uses the `SB_RGBA_DRV` hard IP primitive; its pins (39, 40, 41) cannot be directly driven as regular GPIO.
- The global pin constraint file `VSDSquadronFM.pcf` contains all pin assignments. Unmatched pin warnings during build are normal and harmless.
- Flashing requires `sudo` (for `iceprog` USB access).

## Tests

Each test lives in its own folder with a `Makefile` and `README.md`.

| # | Folder | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `led_counter/` | 4-bit binary counter on LEDs, 0.5s per step |
| 2 | `buzzer/` | Continuous 1 kHz tone |
| 3 | `push_switch/` | Each push switch lights its paired LED |
| 4 | `rgb_led/` | Cycles 7 colors: R, G, B, Y, C, M, W (1s each) |
| 5 | `servo/` | 360° servo: CW 3s, stop 1s, CCW 3s, stop 1s |
| 6 | `toggle_switch/` | SW1 toggles buzzer, SW2 toggles servo |
| 7 | `seven_seg/` | 2-digit counter 00–99, 0.5s per step |
| 8 | `oled/` | Stripe animation then "VSD" text on OLED |
| 9 | `adc/` | ADS1015 ADC on PMOD, voltage level shown on LEDs |
| — | `default_state/` | All outputs OFF (flashed after tests) |

### Build and flash a single test

```bash
cd led_counter
make clean build
sudo make flash
```

This works for any test folder. Each project's Makefile includes the shared build rules from the root `Makefile`.

### Run all tests

The `test_kit.sh` script builds, flashes, and walks through all 9 tests one by one, showing expected behaviour and asking for pass/fail confirmation. After all tests, it flashes the default clean state.

```bash
chmod +x test_kit.sh
sudo ./test_kit.sh
```

At the end, a summary shows how many tests passed out of 9 and the board is left in its default clean state.
