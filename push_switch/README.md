# Push Switch Test

Each of the 4 push switches controls one LED.
Press a switch and the corresponding LED lights up.

**Pins:** SW1=9→LED1=13, SW2=10→LED2=18, SW3=11→LED3=19, SW4=12→LED4=21

**Note:** Switches are active-high, LEDs are active-low. Logic is inverted in code.

**Expected:** Pressing each switch turns on its paired LED.
