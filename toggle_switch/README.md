# Toggle Switch Test

Two toggle switches control the buzzer and servo motor.
Both switches default OFF (active-high).

- **Toggle SW1** (pin 4) — Buzzer ON/OFF (continuous 1 kHz tone)
- **Toggle SW2** (pin 6) — Servo 360° cycle: CW → stop → CCW → stop

**Expected:** Flip each toggle to enable/disable its peripheral.
